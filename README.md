##Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This document explains how the script works.



###Prerequisites
In order to run the script you should clone this repository and make sure that the R packages  plyr  and  dplyr  are installed.

You'll also need to have the original Samsung set data in a folder named UCI HAR Dataset in the repository directory. The original set wasn't included because too big to be conveniently transferred via Git.



###How it works


###Preparation
The script creates two common variables:
. features : holds the meaningful names of the features, from the  features.txt 
  file

. activities : holds the descriptive names of the activities, from the        
  activity_labels.txt  file

  The script also defines three functions for the operations to be executed on the
  test and training sets:

. readset : reads the data of the set given the path to the CSV file in a data
  frame and assigns  features  to variable names, as to give them menaingful names

. readsetactivities : reads and joins the labels of each test set           
  (either  y_text.txt  or  y_train.txt ) with  activities , in order to give
  numeric activities in  each set a descriptive name


. readsetsubjects : reads the subjects of each set into a data frame


###Set creation
For each of the test and train sets a grouping variable is created which contains 4 variables:

. set : the result of executing  readset  on either  X_test.txt  or  X_train.txt 

. activities : the result of executing  readsetactivities  on either  y_test.txt  
or  y_train.txt 

. subjects : the result of executing  readsetsubjects  on either  subject_test.txt  or  subject_train.txt 

. fullset : the result of  cbind ing  activities ,  subjects  and  set 



###Set merging
Then the two  fullset s are merged by binding all their rows together with  rbind  and only the columns containing means and stds of measures (in addition to subjects and activities) are extracted with a regular expression



###Final result
The final result is obtained by grouping the merged and column-filtered data frame by subject and activity and computing the mean of all the remaining rows for each group
